          <h2>History</h2>
          <p class="quote"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> <i>When I was a foal, I lived for stories about underdogs. Finding that source of strength inside, rather than relying on just physical muscle – that was the recipe to overcoming anything, right? I believed you could conquer the world with just a dream and a go get it attitude… but that isn’t how life goes, is it? When you’re young, you don’t see the steps it takes. It was like Nana could spring meals into existence with a mere snap of her hooves. The entire recipe for making trail mix was simply: “get Nana”. Later, that list expanded to gathering supplies, preparing ingredients, and so on – and “get Nana” became a single step in the process. Finding that inner strength? That’s somewhere between crushing the oats and dumping everything into a bowl, I think.</i> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>
          <hr>
          <p>Goose was born undersized, but had dreams bigger than even the largest equids. He’d curl up against his family’s sides, listening as they told stories of David and Goliath, the Olympians and the Titans, and of Odysseus, tricking the Cyclops. He’d cheer them on, his young little voice just on this side of a little squeaky honk, as they found their victory. And every night, before he drifted off, his father would remind him where his own strength lay – to never forget it, and to use it as he chased his dreams.</p>
          <p>And chase, he did.</p>
          <p>He was almost too young when he started his journey, parting from the peace of the country to find the busy chaos of the mountain towns, full of people and wonder. There was a drive, deep within Goose, to find others like… like him. Those who wanted more from life, to make it memorable, something fun, to be proud of, and to share that with the world.</p>
          <p>Finding them was much harder than expected. Goose often stayed on the safer outskirts, joining the occasional mixed-bag group of Equids, humans, and even a handful of wild brumbies as they drifted in and out, but never straying far from the town - he’d envisioned it for so long, building a life for himself here, amongst the flickering lamplights and paved streets! And yet… and yet. He was surrounded by others, many of whom seemed like him - wanderers, dream-chasers, living in the moment and still hoping to catch something even better out there, even if they couldn’t quite fathom what – but he had never felt so lonely. He would dance to their music in the streets, share their food at meals, and bore their hearts’ burdens as he did his own, but never did he actually feel a connection.</p>
          <p>It was with little pain that he bid them farewell each time, and with increasing weariness he greeted the next band.</p>
          <p>He lost track of faces. He forgot names. He couldn’t remember if the equid who bore a metal horseshoe on his left rear hood was named Billie or Brendon, couldn’t remember if he was a buckskin or just a really light bay. It was rare that he would see a familiar face after they moved on, and it took so, so much for him to keep going.</p>
          <p>And then a rumor took root. He never learned who started it, or what it truly was. Some said he was running from a great crime, others said he was planning one this very moment. You could tell, they would say, because of the way he talks, because he never keeps friends long, because of that far away look in his eyes… The air soured, the shadows jeered. And any last hopes of companionship vanished, into the cold, dry, mountain air.</p>
          <p>It was then that Goose found that inner strength, that will and fire that he had admired in his heroes – and he walked away from the poisoned ideal that had for so long held his heart.</p>
          <p>He’d become afraid of returning home a failure, after two years of being away – but he’d found his paradise, hadn’t he, he just hadn’t realized it then. The nights he remembered? Most were at home, with Nana and Pawpaw and his Papa and Mama and all of his aunts and uncles and cousins and every branch of that thick, wild family tree that nurtured him. No – this was not a meek running away, tail between the legs. This was triumph.</p>
          <p>He turned his nose toward home, his newfound victory and purpose leading his hooves through hills and river alike.</p>
          <p>The first sight of berries on the trail – the truest sign that he was nearly there – almost brought him to tears. Cresting the ridge to find the family out taking care of the largest harvest of the year, though, tipped over the dam. There, they all were: healthy. Whole. Happy. His. The ones most like him had been at his side the whole time, fostering his dreams and coaxing his heart into blooming.</p>
          <p>It would be easy to regret – but that was never the point, was it? Everyone needs to take a journey, and sometimes it leads back home. He had made those memories that never die. He’d found the strength of his heart, and followed the path it led him to, all the way back to his family. His friends. His community.</p>

          <p class="quote"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> <i>I was away for a long time, but they welcomed me back as if I’d just gone for a walk that morning. This was always home, it just took me a bit to understand that, to find the courage to come back when I realized where it’d been this whole time. This year’s harvest feast will be the biggest and best yet, because we’re all here. I might be an uncle soon, the way things are going, and to be honest… I’m excited to teach the little squirt some songs that I learned out there. And then, of course, pass them back to their parents, because I really want to see their reactions after their precious little dear does a full-body butt shake and hoof stomp to a solidly thumping dance beat.</i> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>
