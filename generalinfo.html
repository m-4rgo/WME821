          <h2>General</h2>
          <div><p>Goose is a youthful and spirited adventurer, embodying the essence of an underdog with a boundless appetite for exploration and discovery. Having left home with a heart full of curiosity and dreams, Goose is now returning, carrying rich stories and lessons learned. Weary and tired from the time spent apart, his soul now yearning for that herd connection and endless affection offered by those he left.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Personality Traits:</h3>
          <h4>Adventurous Spirit:</h4>
          <p>Goose thrives on new experiences and the thrill of the unknown. This character is fearless in the face of challenges, always eager to push boundaries and explore uncharted territories. His adventurous nature is both a source of inspiration and occasional recklessness.</p>
          <h4>Underdog Mentality:</h4>
          <p>Coming from humble beginnings, Goose has often been underestimated by others. This fuels a determined and resilient attitude, propelling him to prove his worth through actions rather than words. Goose embraces setbacks as opportunities to grow, never giving up no matter the odds.</p>
          <h4>Curious and Inquisitive:</h4>
          <p>Goose's mind is a wellspring of questions and wonder. He observes the world with wide eyes, eager to learn about the earth around him. This curiosity often leads to unexpected discoveries or alliances.</p>
          <h4>Loyal and Compassionate:</h4>
          <p>Despite his independent streak, Goose deeply values friendships and connections. The experiences away from home have heightened his empathy for others who struggle or feel out of place. Goose is quick to lend a hand or stand up for the underdog, reflecting his own journey.</p>
          <h4>Resourceful and Clever:</h4>
          <p>Growing up as an underdog in a challenging environment, Goose has honed a sharp wit and adaptability. He can think on his feet, using creativity and cunning to navigate obstacles, whether in wild forests, high snow-filled mountains, or bustling plains.</p>
          <h4>Optimistic with a Touch of Naivety:</h4>
          <p>Goose carries a hopeful outlook, believing that good things await beyond every horizon. However, this optimism can sometimes clash with harsh realities, leading to moments of vulnerability or disillusionment — yet he always bounces back stronger.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p class="quote"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> <i>When I was a foal, I lived for stories of the underdogs; finding that source of strength inside, rather than relying on just physical muscle – that was the recipe to overcoming anything, right? When you’re young, though, it’s like Nanas just magically spring meals into being. The entire recipe for making cookies is just simply “get Nana”. Later, that list expands to the flour, the sugar, the oats, and so on – and “get mama” becomes a single step in the process. Finding that inner strength? That’s somewhere between preheating the oven and mixing wet and dry, I think.</i> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>
          <hr>
          <p>Goose was born undersized, but had dreams bigger than even the largest Equid’s. He’d curl up against his family’s sides, listening as they told stories of David and Goliath, the Olympians and the Titans, and of Odysseus, tricking the Cyclops. He’d cheer them on, his young little voice just on this side of a little squeaky honk, as they found their victory. And every night, just before drifting off, his father would remind him where his own strength lay – to never forget it, and to use it as he chased his dreams.</p>
          <p>And chase, he did.</p>
          <p>He was almost too young when he started his journey, parting from the peace of the country to find the hustle and bustle of the urban life. There was a drive, deep within Goose, to find others like… like him. Those who wanted more from life, to make it memorable, something fun, to be proud of, and to share that strength of heart and will with the world.</p>
          <p>Finding them was much harder than expected. Goose often stayed on the safer outskirts, joining the occasional group as they drifted in and out, but never straying far from the city - he’d envisioned it for so long, building a life for himself here, amongst the lights! And yet… and yet. He was surrounded by others, many of whom seemed like him - wanderers, dream-chasers, living in the moment and still hoping to catch something even better out there, even if they couldn’t quite fathom what – but he had never felt so lonely. He would dance to their music in the streets, share their food at meals, and bore their hearts’ burdens as he did his own, but never did he actually feel a connection.</p>
          <p>It was with little pain that he bid them farewell each time, and with increasing weariness he greeted the next band.</p>
          <p>He lost track of faces. He forgot names. It was rare that he would see a familiar face after they moved on, and it took so, so much for him to keep going.</p>
          <p>It took even more from him when a rumor took root. He never learned who started it, or where it came from, but when he was accused of roadside thievery, of swindling and seducing, the city suddenly became hostile, as if barbs rose from the very streets to strike at him. The air soured, the shadows jeered. The urbanites that lived around him became mosquitoes and rats, sucking the life out of him and taking even the scraps.</p>
          <p>And Goose found that inner strength, that will and fire that he had admired in David and Odysseus – and he walked away from the poisoned ideal that had for so long held his heart.</p>
          <p>He’d become afraid of returning home a failure, after two years of being away – but he’d found his paradise, hadn’t he, he just hadn’t realized it then. The nights he remembered? Most were at home, with Nana and Pawpaw and his Papa and Mama and all of his aunts and uncles and cousins and every branch of that thick, wild family tree that nurtured him. He just had to find the strength in his heart to look back and realize – that was where he belonged.</p>
          <p>He turned his nose toward home, his newfound victory and purpose leading his hooves through hills and river alike.</p>
          <p>The first sight of berries on the trail – the truest sign that he was nearly there – almost brought him to tears. Cresting the ridge to find the family out taking care of the largest harvest of the year, though, tipped over the dam. There, they all were: healthy. Whole. Happy. His. The ones most like him had been at his side the whole time, fostering his dreams and coaxing his heart into blooming.</p>
          <p>He’d regret not listening then – but that was never the point, was it? He had made those memories that never die. He’d found the strength of his heart, and followed the path it led him to, all the way back to his family. His friends. His community.</p>

          <p class="quote"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> <i>I was away for a long time, but they welcomed me back as if I’d just gone for a walk that morning. This was always home, it just took me a bit to understand that, to find the courage to come back when I realized where it’d been this whole time. This year’s harvest feast will be the biggest and best yet, because we’re all here. I’m likely about to become an uncle, the way things are going, and to be honest… I’m excited to teach the little squirt some songs that I learned out there. And then, of course, pass them back to their parents, because I really want to see their reactions after their precious little dear does a full-body butt shake and hoof stomp to a solidly thumping dance beat.</i> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></p>
